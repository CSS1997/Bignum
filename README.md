# Bignum

realize the overloading of basic operators(+ - * / >> <<);<br>
compile the demo with instructions : `g++ -o a.exe main.cpp Bignum.cpp`;<br>
and run it with the instructions : `a.exe input_file_path output_file_path` <br>
which input_file_path is the path of input file and the other is output file.<br>
but there must be a space between numerals and operators (like that : 123 + 456)<br>
